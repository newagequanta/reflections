What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    First thoughts:
        Git creates the necessary metadata in .git file
        No commits on the repository yet
        We need to do it to bring the directory UNDER Git control
    Analysis:
        Git gives the user total control on even the first commit
        E.g. what do you want to put in the description

How is the staging are different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    First thoughts:
        Not all files will change logically all the time
        This might provide a way to segregate items that will change
    Analysis
        Need to understand more before any analysis
